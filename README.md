# SysUpdater

**SysUpdater** is a lightweight and efficient Rust-based tool designed for automating system and Flatpak updates on Fedora Linux. It ensures your system is always up-to-date by handling updates, unused package cleanup, and reboots seamlessly.

---

## Features

- Automates both system (`dnf5`) and Flatpak updates.
- Provides real-time output for update processes.
- Handles cleanup of unused packages.
- Detects if a reboot is required and prompts the user for action.
- Designed specifically for Fedora but may work on other Linux distributions with minor tweaks.

---

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Fedora Linux (or compatible distributions).
- **Rust**: SysUpdater is written in Rust. You'll need Rust installed for building the binary from source.
